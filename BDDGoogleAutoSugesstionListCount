//As per my understanding , the expected scenario is listed below:
Feature: Google Search Text Box 
Scenario: The total number of Auto suggestions and its count that google displays
    Given   A opened web browser with Google home page 
    When    The user enters "Test Automation" into the Google search Text Box
    Then    List of all the Auto suggestion related to "Test Automation" should display
    Then    List of Total Auto suggestion Count of "Test Automation" should display and print
